## üí° Inspiration
**Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the World**. Some people are, at higher risk of skin cancer than others, but anyone can get it. In the U.S., more than 9,500 people are diagnosed with skin cancer daily. More than two people die of the disease every hour.
To help this situation our team came up with the idea of _Medicinally_ where users can check their predictions of having melanoma aka skin cancer by just uploading an image. Users can also get cryptocurrency after posting their data for research purposes.

Another important thing, according to Journal published in The Lancet  **India, has the world's most considerable shortage of blood**, with all states together battling a huge shortfall of 41 million units and demand outstripping supply by over 400%,  And demand is rising, says the findings. To help this as well we have added yet another remarkable feature in Medicinally where we have provided a blood donation portal where the users can request blood donation and donors can directly contact hospitals for assistance. The ones who need blood donation can request the required blood type after uploading their prescription. We have also provided a list of the blood bank of hospitals. these features make things easier for all blood donation purposes.

Our website _Medicinally_  will help people in need of blood and medical care. It will make things easier for donors as well as hospitals and we wish even if this is a small contribution from our side, it can tackle the problem even a little bit.

## üíª What it does

Our web app **Medicinally** is built with the following features:
- Skin cancer detection
- Blood donation portal
- Get cryptocurrency for donating your data for research purposes
- A sentiment analysis of the user's daily diary to determine the user's mood

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Js
- Backend: Django
- NLP: Cohere
- ML: Tensorflow Js

## ü§ñ Best Use of NLP with Cohere

We are using Cohere for building the Sentimental Analyzer for the daily diary page and sending some random quotes. Cohere helps us with the NLP. Using Choere API was very easy. Cohere provides us with the sentiment score and the sentiment label. We are using the sentiment score to calculate the score for the day. We are using the sentiment label to show the user the sentiment of the day.

## üîê Best Use of DeSo

We are using DeSo for sending crypto rewards to users. We are using DeSo API for sending the rewards. Using DeSo API was very easy.

## üß† Challenges we ran into

- Completing the project was challenging because we had to implement the project by a deadline.
- It was my first time learning how to use Cohere with Frontend and creating a backend with it.
- It was my first time using DeSo for sending crypto rewards to users.

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are proud of the fact that we were able to complete the project in the given time.
- We are proud of the fact that we were able to make the ML Model.

## üìñ What we learned

- How to use Django with Frontend.
- Using Cohere and DeSo

## üöÄ What's next for Medicinally

- Building a mobile app.
- Improving the Accuracy of the ML Model
- Adding more features.
